# Project Coding Rules (Non-Obvious Only)
- All vector and matrix operations must use the custom utilities in [`sources/math.h`](sources/math.h:1).
- Pattern generation logic is centralized in [`sources/pattern.h`](sources/pattern.h:1).
- Image export must be done using the `ExportPPM` function from [`sources/ppm.h`](sources/ppm.h:1).
